-- This model aggregates language statistics by joining data from the `dim_language`, 
-- `bridge_country_languages`, `dim_country`, and `fct_country_stats` tables. It generates 
-- key language statistics including:
-- - `speaking_countries`: The number of distinct countries that speak a particular language.
-- - `total_speakers_potential`: The sum of populations of countries that speak the language.
-- - `regions_present`: A list of regions where the language is spoken, aggregated and ordered.
-- Additionally, it calculates:
-- - `pct_countries_speaking`: The percentage of countries that speak the language relative to 
--   the total number of distinct countries.
-- - `distribution_category`: A categorical label that describes the spread of the language:
--   - 'Unique to one country' for languages spoken in only one country.
--   - 'Regional' for languages spoken in up to three countries.
--   - 'Multi-regional' for languages spoken in up to ten countries.
--   - 'Widespread' for languages spoken in more than ten countries.
